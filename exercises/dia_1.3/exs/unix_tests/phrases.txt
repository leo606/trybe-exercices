Be yourself; everyone else is already taken
Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe
So many books, so little time
A room without books is like a body without a soul
You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
Be the change that you wish to see in the world
